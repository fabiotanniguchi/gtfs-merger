 This GTFS Merger Tool is suitable for merging in the following context:
 - you have a "priority GTFS", with a piece of a transit system
 - and you have an "other GTFS", with another piece of the same transit system (intersection with both pieces can be not empty)

 The result GTFS will have an equal or greater piece of the transit system, comparing routes with same short name and skipping "other GTFS" routes in this situation.
